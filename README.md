# Tutorial for Estimate Foersts Fire Damage from Above with GEE and geemap

The Python notebook provided serves as a tutorial for individuals interested in exploring and analyzing burned forest areas. The tutorial focuses on the utilization of satellite imagery and Google Earth Engine, a cloud-based platform that allows users to process large amounts of geospatial data.

The case study presented in the notebook is particularly insightful, focusing on the Northern Israel districts. By leveraging the power of satellite imagery, the tutorial demonstrates how to easily compute and visualize the extent of burned areas in forests. This is achieved through the application of remote sensing techniques, which involve the interpretation of data collected by satellites.

The notebook also highlights the use of geemap, a Python package that simplifies the process of working with geospatial data in Google Earth Engine. Geemap provides a range of functionalities, including the ability to display satellite imagery, overlay data layers, and create interactive maps.
